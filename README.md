LEVEL 1

**Calculator**



To be honest I am actually not much good at using GitHub so I can't create a folder in the repository to hold all the different task files and if I just upload them like this it won't make any sense as all will be named almost same and will cause you trouble in running so that's why I am gonna Make each task into one single HTML file with css and js in STYLE and SCRIPT tags.
